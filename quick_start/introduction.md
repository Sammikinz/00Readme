Choose target area and navigation routes in your site2.	Distribute iBeacons along with the routes3.	Prepare **fingerprinting** data for localization4.	Prepare map data for the App5.	Test the app with your map6.	Submit the map data for public use7.	Let your blind users try blind navigation in your site
